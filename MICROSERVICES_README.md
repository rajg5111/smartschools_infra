# School API Microservices Architecture

## Overview

The School API has been refactored from a single monolithic Lambda function into separate microservices, with each endpoint handled by its own dedicated Lambda function. This provides better scalability, monitoring, and maintainability.

## Architecture Benefits

### üéØ **Single Responsibility Principle**

- Each Lambda function has one specific purpose
- Easier to understand, test, and maintain
- Reduced complexity per function

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**

- Right-sized resources for each operation
- Faster cold starts with smaller codebases
- Independent scaling per endpoint

### üìä **Better Monitoring**

- Granular metrics per operation
- Easier to identify performance bottlenecks
- Individual error tracking

### üí∞ **Cost Optimization**

- Pay only for what each function uses
- Different memory/timeout configurations
- More efficient resource utilization

- `softDelete=true` - Performs soft delete (marks as deleted)
- Default behavior is hard delete (permanent removal)

**Soft Delete Response:**

```json

  "message": "School soft deleted successfully",
  "school": {
    "status": "deleted",
    "deleted_at": "2025-10-06T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## IAM Permissions

Each Lambda function has minimal required permissions:

### schools-list

- `dynamodb:Scan` - List all schools

### schools-create

- `dynamodb:GetItem` - Check for duplicates
- `dynamodb:PutItem` - Create new records

### schools-get

- `dynamodb:GetItem` - Read single record

### schools-update

- `dynamodb:GetItem` - Validate existence
- `dynamodb:UpdateItem` - Update records

### schools-delete

- `dynamodb:GetItem` - Validate existence
- `dynamodb:DeleteItem` - Hard delete
- `dynamodb:UpdateItem` - Soft delete

## Configuration

### Resource Sizing Strategy

| Function       | Memory | Timeout | Rationale                    |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| schools-list   | 256 MB | 30s     | Handles scanning operations  |
| schools-create | 256 MB | 30s     | Input validation + DB writes |
| schools-get    | 128 MB | 15s     | Simple read operation        |
| schools-update | 256 MB | 30s     | Validation + update logic    |
| schools-delete | 256 MB | 30s     | Validation + delete logic    |

### Common Environment Variables

- `SCHOOLS_TABLE_NAME` - DynamoDB table name
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity (debug/warn)

## Error Handling

All functions implement consistent error handling:

- **400** - Bad Request (validation errors)
- **404** - Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- **409** - Conflict (duplicate resources)
- **500** - Internal Server Error (unexpected errors)

## CORS Support

All endpoints include CORS headers:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`

## Monitoring & Logging

### CloudWatch Metrics

- Invocation count per function
- Duration per function
- Error rate per function
- Throttle rate per function

### X-Ray Tracing

- Enabled on all functions
- End-to-end request tracing
- Performance bottleneck identification

### Log Retention

- 1 week retention for all functions
- Structured JSON logging
- Request/response logging

## Deployment

```bash
# Deploy all microservices
cdk deploy

# Functions are built automatically from Docker containers
# Each function gets its own CloudFormation resources
```

## API Gateway Integration

Each Lambda function can be integrated with API Gateway:

```typescript
// Example integration
const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, "SchoolsApi");
const schools = api.root.addResource("schools");

// GET /schools -> schools-list
schools.addMethod(
  "GET",
  new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(lambdaConstruct.getFunction("schools-list"))
);

// POST /schools -> schools-create
schools.addMethod(
  "POST",
  new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(
    lambdaConstruct.getFunction("schools-create")
  )
);

// GET /schools/{id} -> schools-get
const school = schools.addResource("{schoolId}");
school.addMethod(
  "GET",
  new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(lambdaConstruct.getFunction("schools-get"))
);
```

## Testing

Each microservice can be tested independently:

```bash
# Test individual functions
aws lambda invoke --function-name schools-list-development response.json

# Load testing per endpoint
# Integration testing across functions
# Unit testing per function
```

## Migration Benefits

### Before (Monolithic)

- ‚ùå Single large function handling all operations
- ‚ùå Same resources for different workloads
- ‚ùå Difficult to optimize performance
- ‚ùå Harder to debug issues

### After (Microservices)

- ‚úÖ Dedicated function per operation
- ‚úÖ Right-sized resources per workload
- ‚úÖ Independent scaling and optimization
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging and monitoring
- ‚úÖ Better separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Independent deployment capability

This microservices architecture provides a solid foundation for scaling the School API while maintaining clean separation of concerns and optimal resource utilization.
